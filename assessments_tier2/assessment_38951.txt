====================================================================
ANALYSIS:
====================================================================
Self-Grade: 95 → Actual: 72 = OVERCONFIDENT by 23 points

STRENGTHS:
- Perfect project planning and architecture documentation
- Exceptional testing (150+ tests, 93% coverage)
- Excellent security practices
- Professional Angular implementation
- Strong code quality and extensibility

WEAKNESSES:
- No research/analysis component (0 points on Skill 5)
- No cost analysis (0 points on Skill 8)
- Missing prompt book (reduced Skill 7)

This is a technically excellent implementation with professional-grade
testing and documentation, but missing the academic research components.
