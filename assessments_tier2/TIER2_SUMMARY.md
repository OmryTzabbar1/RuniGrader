## Statistical Analysis

### Grade Distribution
- **Below Standard (<55):** 5 students (100%)
  - 7.0, 23.5, 35.0, 39.0, 42.0
- **Potential (55-79):** 0 students
- **Good (80-89):** 0 students
- **Excellence (90-100):** 0 students

**Average Actual Grade:** 29.3/100
**Average Self-Grade:** 94.4/100
**Average Overconfidence:** 65.1 points

### Self-Assessment Accuracy
All Tier 2 students were **significantly overconfident**:
- Smallest overestimation: 46 points (Student 38952)
- Largest overestimation: 88 points (Student 38951)

### Common Patterns

**Skills with 0 points across all students:**
- Research & Analysis: 5/5 students (100%) - NO ONE did notebooks/analysis
- Costs & Pricing: 5/5 students (100%) - NO ONE did cost analysis

**Skills with generally poor performance:**
- UI/UX: Average 0.5/10 - almost no interface documentation
- Testing Quality: Average 2.6/10 - minimal unit tests
- Version Management: Average 0.9/10 - missing prompt books

**Best performing skill:**
- Project Planning: Average 4.0/10 (2 students scored 10/10)
- Configuration & Security: Average 7.0/10

### Critical Issues
- **Student 38951:** SECURITY FAILURE - hardcoded secrets in code (auto-fail on security)
- **Student 38954:** ZERO planning documentation (no PRD/architecture)

---

## Key Findings

1. **Massive Self-Assessment Inflation:**
   All Tier 2 students claimed 88-100/100 but scored 7-42/100 (avg 29.3)

2. **Universal Gaps:**
   NO Tier 2 student completed research notebooks or cost analysis

3. **Documentation Quality Issues:**
   Most had minimal documentation, missing critical planning docs

4. **Security Concerns:**
   At least one student had hardcoded secrets (critical failure)

5. **Testing Neglect:**
   Almost all students had minimal or no unit tests

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All 5 Tier 2 students individually assessed with orchestrator
2. ⏳ Update Excel file with actual grades (file currently open)
3. ⏳ Generate individual Report2 PDFs with detailed feedback
4. ⏳ Create final summary for all 36 students
