## Criteria Analysis

### Most Commonly Met Criteria (across 9 accessible repos)
1. **README File (Comprehensive)** - 9/9 (100%)
2. **Modular Project Structure** - 8/9 (89%)
3. **Configuration Files** - 8/9 (89%)
4. **Visualization** - 8/9 (89%)
5. **Parameter Investigation** - 9/9 (100%)

### Most Commonly Missing Criteria (across 9 accessible repos)
1. **Cost Analysis** - Only 1/9 met (11%) - 63713 only!
2. **Budget Management** - Only 1/9 met (11%) - 63713 only!
3. **Best Practices with Git** - 3/9 met (33%)
4. **Code Quality and Comments** - 4/9 met (44%)
5. **Results Analysis Notebook** - 5/9 met (56%)

### Key Findings
- **Cost analysis is the weakest area** - Only 1 submission (63713) included comprehensive cost/budget documentation
- **Git practices need improvement** - Many submissions have 1-4 commits (poor development tracking)
- **Strong documentation overall** - All accessible repos have READMEs and most have PRDs
- **Good parameter investigation** - All submissions tested multiple parameters/error rates
- **Testing infrastructure varies widely** - From 0 tests to 191 tests

## Assignment Quality Insights

### Strengths Across Submissions
1. **Documentation:** Most submissions had comprehensive READMEs and many had PRDs
2. **Experimentation:** All accessible repos conducted parameter investigations
3. **Visualization:** Most included graphs/charts showing results
4. **Modular Structure:** Good code organization in most submissions

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Cost Analysis:** Critical gap - only 1/9 submissions addressed cost/budget
2. **Git Best Practices:** Many submissions had minimal commit history (1-4 commits)
3. **Testing:** Only 4/9 had comprehensive unit tests
4. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Only 5/9 included analysis notebooks
5. **Architecture Documentation:** Only 5/9 had formal architecture docs

### Comparison with Previous Assignments
- **Assignment 1 Average:** ~50% (estimated based on previous pattern)
- **Assignment 2 Average:** ~55% (estimated)
- **Assignment 3 Average:** 63% (for accessible repos)
- **Trend:** Improving quality, but cost analysis remains a major gap

## Final Notes

**Assessment Quality:** All assessments were conducted by reviewing actual repository contents (when accessible), checking all 22 criteria systematically, and providing specific file references and examples.

**Fairness:** Duplicate submissions received the same scores as originals. Inaccessible repositories and missing URLs were marked as 0/22 with clear explanations.

**Outstanding Achievement:** Participant 63713 (Ron Kozitsa) is the only submission with comprehensive cost analysis - a critical professional skill that was severely lacking across all other submissions.

**Recommendation for Course Improvement:** Future assignments should emphasize cost/budget analysis more strongly, as this is a critical real-world skill that was missing from 89% of submissions.
