# Grading Temporary Files

This folder contains temporary scripts and data files used during grading.

## Scripts:
- analyze_submissions.py: Analyzes student tier distribution
- calculate_grades.py: Calculates grades for all students
- assess_*.py: Individual assessment scripts (deprecated - use orchestrator)

## Data Files:
- grading_analysis.txt: Summary of tier distribution
- grades_hw1_submissions.json: List of all PDFs

## Note:
Most of these are deprecated. Use the tier2-orchestrator instead:
`.claude/skills/tier2-orchestrator/orchestrator.py`
